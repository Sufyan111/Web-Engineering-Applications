There are 4 core concepts in Object Oriented programming :-

Before OOPs code was written in Function and variables which results in multiple repetation of code.

Hence OOPs was intoduced.

1. Encapsulation.
   Grouping related Properties(variables) and Methods(Functions) inside a class is called Encapsulation.

2. Abstraction.
   Hiding some properties and methods from accessing outside of class is called Abstraction. It reduces the Impact of Change from outside as deleting and editing from outside of a class won't impact the original Property or Method.

3. Inheritance.
   Elements/Methods which have or require common properties can be defined in one class and can be called in multiple classes......this process is known as Inheritance. It helps in reducing redundant code(No longer needed).

4. Polymorphism.
   Poly : Many, morph : Forms.
   A single method or property have same name and behaves differently inside different classes or methods, is called as polymorphism
